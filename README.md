### Brief Description
This research paper analyzer is a full-stack LLM web application built in Flask that allows users to interact with uploaded research papers (PDFs) through an AI-powered chatbot. It processes uploaded PDFs by converting them into searchable vector embeddings through FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) indexes and uses the Mistral AI API to generate context-based answers. Some examples of questions one may ask to the chatbot can include:

*What data collection techniques were applied in this study? <br />
What are the parameters or variables studied? <br />
What conclusions were drawn from the hypothesis? <br />
What gaps in literature does this paper address?*

### Tech Stack & Frameworks
Python, LangChain, Mistral AI API, Flask, FAISS
